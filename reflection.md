### HTML

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
I tried to do it on my own but I was unsure how to do it so I went to the videos and learned stuff like fieldbox.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
I found the exercises really helpful. I didn't know how to make tables until now but I couldn't get the images of the puppy or kitty so I got my own images. I hope thats ok.
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
I thought it was great I knew some of this but it was a great reminder.
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?
No, I think learning is best by examples and thinks I can look back at if I need help.
